This code defines a function `plot_gantt_chart` that takes a list of tasks and plots a Gantt chart for them. Each task is represented as a tuple containing the task name, start time, and end time. The function uses the `matplotlib` library to create the chart, with each task displayed as a horizontal bar. The y-axis represents the tasks, and the x-axis represents time. The chart is then displayed using the `plt.show()` function.

In the example usage, a list of tasks is created and passed to the `plot_gantt_chart` function to generate the Gantt chart.
